        <p>TokenDog NFT is an innovative network of digital artworks (NFTs) that runs on the Ethereum Smart Block Chain.
        </p>
        <p>The app makes use of smart contracts (each referred to as a "Smart Contract") that were built particularly to allow users to build, retain, and relocate digital TokenDog’s that are all one-of-a-kind. This can be viewed on a site that the user is familiar with (the "Site"). This Site and the Smart Contracts are collectively referred to as the "App" in these conditions. Users may view their TokenDog’s and utilize Smart Contracts to exchange TokenDog’s with other app users using the App.
        </p>
        <p>Please read and agree to these Terms of Use (“Terms”) before using the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts.
        </p>
        <p>BE SURE TO READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE APP, THE WEBSITE, OR THE SMART CONTRACTS. UNLESS WE HAVE CREATED AND AGREED ON A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH YOU, THE FOLLOWING TERMS GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE APP, THE SITE, AND THE SMART CONTRACT. WE WILL ONLY MAKE THE APP, THE WEBSITE, AND THE SMART CONTRACTS AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OUTLINED. YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU HAVE REVIEWED, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS BY USING THE APP, THE SITE, AND THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR ANY PART OF THEM. YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE LEGALLY AUTHORIZED TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF ANY LEGAL ENTITY YOU REPRESENT (EX. A COMPANY) BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF THAT ENTITY. “YOU” WILL REFER TO THAT ENTITY IN THAT CASE. WE WILL NOT MAKE THE APP, THE SITE, OR THE SMART CONTRACTS AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH LEGAL AUTHORITY OR IF YOU ARE UNWILLING TO ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS.

        <p>2. The App
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>You must install and use the Google Chrome/Brave internet browser if you want to have a smooth experience with the App. After you've completed the installation, you should install the "MetaMask" browser extension. If you live in the United States, the extension is required to make purchases directly through Coinbase or through third-party sites. It also allows you to keep track of your Ethereum cryptocurrency and make trades with it. Please note that you will not be able to conduct transactions on the App unless you use MetaMask or another Ethereum-compatible browser.
            <br />
            The app will recognize you as a user, and you will be able to interact with it only if your Ethereum wallet is unlocked and connected through your MetaMask account. There are no other options for establishing a direct connection with the App and registering as a user.
          </li>
          <li>The Ethereum Smart Chain confirms and regulates all transactions made through the App. Please keep in mind that every time you make a transaction on the App, your Ethereum public address will be visible to the public.
          </li>
          <li>We do not own Ethereum Smart Chain, MetaMask, Coinbase, Google Chrome, or any other third-party website, service, or product that you might visit, see or utilize to access the App's many functionalities. We will not be held liable for third-party providers' omissions or conduct, and we will not be held liable for any damage you may suffer as a result of your engagement with any of these third-party providers.
          </li>
          <li>You can interact with the Smart Contracts that we produce directly through the Ethereum Smart Chain, without having to use the App as a portal. The process can be fairly complicated, so if you're having difficulties understanding it, the Site is the best place to go.
          </li>
          <li>Whether you are aware of it or not, you will be responsible for the security of your MetaMask wallet, as well as any other Ethereum wallets and accounts that you use.
          </li>
          <li>
            This website serves only as a platform for participants to trade digital collectibles. Users are solely responsible for the security and management of their own private Ethereum wallets, as well as confirming and approving all transactions and contracts made through this website. Furthermore, because the TokenDog smart contract runs on the Ethereum network, no transactions can be undone, reversed, or restored.
            <br />
            This website and its related services are offered "as is" and "as available," with no express or implied warranties of any kind. By using this website, you agree to take full responsibility for any and all TokenDog digital collectibles transactions.
          </li>
        </ol>
<h2>OWNERSHIP</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The NFT is yours. On the Ethereum blockchain, each TokenDog is an NFT. You own the underlying TokenDog, the Art, totally when you buy an NFT. We cannot seize, freeze, or otherwise affect the ownership of any TokenDog NFT because it is wholly mediated by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network.
  </li>
  <li>Individual and Personal use. TokenDog provides you a worldwide, royalty-free right to use, copy, and display the acquired Art, along with any additions you choose to produce or use, solely for the following reasons, subject to your continuous compliance with these Terms: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that allows you to buy and sell your TokenDog / NFT, provided that the marketplace cryptographically confirms each TokenDog owner's permission to display the Art for their TokenDog NFT to ensure that only the genuine owner may see the Art; or (iii) as part of a third-party website or application that allows your TokenDog to be included, involved, or participated in, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each TokenDog owner's right to display the Art for their TokenDog NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the TokenDog NFT owner leaves.
  </li>
  <li>
    Commercial Use. TokenDog offers you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the acquired Art for the purpose of generating derivative works based on the Art (“Commercial Use”), subject to your continuous compliance with these Terms. Use of the Art to make and sell goods products (T-Shirts, etc.) exhibiting replicas of the Art is an example of such Commercial Use. Nothing in this Section will be construed as restricting you from doing anything.(i) owning or operating a marketplace that allows the use and sale of TokenDog NFTs in general, as long as the marketplace cryptographically verifies each TokenDog NFT owner's right to display the Art for their TokenDog NFT, ensuring that only the genuine owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third-party website or application that allows TokenDog to be included, involved, or participated in in general, provided that the third-party website or application cryptographically verifies each TokenDog NFT owner's right to display the Art for their TokenDog NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the TokenDog NFT has been deleted; or (iii) earning money from any of the aforementioned.
